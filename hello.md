# Part 1, Client Src Setup
In This First Part ill show u guys how to setup and entire Client Src in the correct way to start Skidding or Actually Coding a client.

U will need in order to start this:
1.- Java JDK 8 (https://adoptium.net/es/temurin/releases) //Choose ur SO, Arch, JDK and Version 8.
2.- Intellij Idea (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
3.- A Client to Work with, u can find p much anyone on ghub just make sure it works and is not broken (used in the tutorial https://github.com/The-Gopro336-Archive/OyVey_Rewrite-BUILDABLE_SRC)
4.- Internet ofc

# Step 1. 
After u downloaded the correct version of JDK u will need to install it, Keep in mind that in the Installer u will need toCheck mark the Java_Home option in order to setup it right

Once u download it just unzip it on ur desktop, it should leave u a Folder with the name Project

DONT CHANGE ANYTHING OR TOUCH ANYTHING YET!!

# Step 4. 
Open the folder with the intellij program, once you do this step it will start downloading important stuff and loading the gradlew configuration!

BEWARE!! Maybe u will find out that when this process is done u will get 3 Forge Errors, if this is the case IGNORE IT!

# Step 5.
Once you open the intellij you will need to do 2 more things to get ur src ready!
